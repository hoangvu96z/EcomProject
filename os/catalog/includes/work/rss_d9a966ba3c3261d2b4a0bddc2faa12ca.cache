<br />
You have 2 blog feed options box or footer and one embed option as a footer.<br />
<br />
The most stable is the embed footer which let you manually insert a selected blog onto your website. You have to update this in admin each time you wish to show a new blog.<br />
Simply go to you blog click share and then embed and copy the script and insert it into the place provided in admin.<br />
<br />
The other option is the box or footer feed. These both (only one can be turned on at any one time) let you add a selected number of blogs automatically from your tumbler account. So all you need to do is add a new blog in your tumbler account and it will automatically show on you website. <br />
<br />
The only problem with this is not all browsers support this function. Works fine on Firefox.<br />
<br />
You can change your options by editing the template file.<br />
<br />
// User settings<br />
	var settings = {<br />
userName : &quot;jcmagpie&quot;, // Your Tumblr user name<br />
<br />
itemsToShow : 10, // Number of Tumblr posts to retrieve<br />
<br />
imageSize : 100, // Values can be 75, 100, 250, 400 or 500<br />
<br />
shortPublishDate : true, // Whether the publishing date should be cut shorter<br />

timeToWait : 2000 // Milliseconds, 1000 = 1 second<br />
